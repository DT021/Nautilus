Solution Cleaning
-----------------

.NET Core projects include bin and obj folders which contain project asset artifacts. These artifacts can accumulate as the solution migrates through different .NET SDK versions, they are not source code and can be generated by the solution itself. 

To cleanup after migrating to a new .NET SDK version - run the bellow commands which will recursively scan for and remove the bin and obj folders and their contents.

WARNING: Run these commands from the /Nautilus/Source directory otherwise it will destory the OS.

	sudo find -type d -name bin -exec rm -rf {} \;
	sudo find -type d -name obj -exec rm -rf {} \;
